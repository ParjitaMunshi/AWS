## My Personal Website
This repository contains the files for my personal website, which is hosted using Amazon S3. Below are the steps I followed to design, set up, and host my website.

## Step 1: Design Your Website
I designed my website using a template from Free CSS. Alternatively, you can design your own website.

## Step 2: Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket
To host my website on Amazon S3, I followed these steps:

# 1. Create an S3 Bucket
Go to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console.
Click "Create bucket".
Enter a unique name for your bucket.
In the "Properties" section, enable "Static website hosting".

# 2. Upload Website Files
Upload your website files to the bucket.
Click on your bucket name.
Click the "Upload" button.
Drag and drop your website files or select them manually.

# 3. Configure Bucket Permissions
Set the bucket permissions to allow public access.
Go to the "Permissions" tab.
Click "Bucket policy" and add a policy to allow public read access. Here is an example policy:
json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::parjitamunshi/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
} 

## 4. Enable Static Website Hosting
In the "Properties" tab, enable "Static website hosting".
Specify the index document (e.g., index.html).

## 5. Access Your Website
Website is now accessible at the endpoint provided in the S3 bucket's static website hosting settings.
